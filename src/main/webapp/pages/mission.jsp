<p style="margin-top:20px;">We believe monetary tips shouldn't
    be limited to  waitresses alone. Why isn't your mechanic, general staff,
    the person who stocks the shelves receiving tips/gifts as well?
    <br/>
    <br/>We want to help level
    the playing field for everyone, give the average man/woman a shot at enjoying life.
    No kidding, working these jobs is tough and we know it. Giving gifts to those who bust
    their butts for us will make the Earth a better place!</p>
